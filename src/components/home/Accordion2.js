        The price for "The Ultimate A.I. Marketing Toolkits" is normally
        $97.00... BUT as part of a pre-launch marketing campaign to gather
        testimonials, we're giving it away for the special price of just $27.00!
        Naturally we can't afford to advertise it at this price for long, so
        grab it now while you still can!
      </AccordionItem2>
      <AccordionItem2 title="Why do I need prompts when I can come up with ideas myself?">
        ChatGPT uses a language model that relies on very precise phrases to
        deliver quality results. This means that one single word can ruin
        results, or really boost them.Using our prompts, you’ll be able to save
        time and unlock features of ChatGPT you never thought possible (while
        your competition is still trying to manually type all their questions).
      </AccordionItem2>
      <AccordionItem2 title="Who is this prompt pack for?">
        We designed this pack to serve the specific needs of coaches, agency
        owners, freelancers, and online entrepreneurs.
      </AccordionItem2>
      <AccordionItem2 title="How is this different from other prompt packs or YouTube videos out there?">
        The reason why you’re reading this is that you likely don’t have much
        free time. So why not get all the condensed, researched prompts that are
        proven to work?We haven’t found any ChatGPT Prompt Pack that includes
        the vast level of detail and the number of tasks that we included. It
        has everything a digital marketer needs to thrive, plus lifetime updates
        to never fall behind.
      </AccordionItem2>
      <AccordionItem2 title="Will this help me with other platforms like Bard or ChatSonic?">
        Sure! ChatGPT is only the most viral AI right now, but these prompts are
        equally applicable to any other AI that uses a dialogue model to
        operate. Microsoft will soon embed to Bing, their search engine, and you
        can sure use our prompt pack there!
